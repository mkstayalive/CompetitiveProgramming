/**
 * Geek has an array Arr, where Arr[i] (1-based indexing) denotes the number of chocolates
 * corresponding to each station. When he move from station i to station i+1 he get A[i] â€“ A[i+1] chocolates for free,
 * if this number is negative, he looses that many chocolates also.
 * He can only move from station i to station i+1, if he has non-negative number of chocolates with him.
 * Given the cost of one chocolate is Rs. P, help geek to find the minimum cost incurred in
 * reaching last station from the first station (station 1).
 * Note: Initially Geek has 0 chocolate.
